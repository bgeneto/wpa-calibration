    <p><strong>sphere diameter:</strong> The sphere diameter should be measured at the ball equatorial plane where the
        laser points on the ball. If not mentioned or impossible to measure, consider 8 cm, which should be close enough
        to the usually used spheres. This measurement is mainly used for the determination of the pendulum speed at the
        laser location. Once the sphere diameter has been measured, store the value in the micro-controller flash by
        using the command "set sphere diameter". Consider to have multiple equatorial readings in different positions
        and take their average value because the sphere is most likely an ellipsoid!</p>
