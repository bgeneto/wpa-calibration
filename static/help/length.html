    <p><strong>pendulum length:</strong> The procedure to measure the string is described in String measurement. Then,
        the radius of the sphere/ball (in the vertical direction, i.e., along the string direction) should be added to
        the string length, resulting in the pendulum length. The unit of length for this quantity is meter (unlike the
        other ones which is centimeter). Once the pendulum length has been measured, store the value in the
        micro-controller flash by using the command "set pendulum length".</p>
