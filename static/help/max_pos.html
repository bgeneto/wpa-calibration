    <p><strong>maximum position:</strong> The shovel maximum position is measured by slowly displacing the shovel with
        the hand towards the end of the sliding structure (when the slider is fully extended). Once the shovel reaches
        the end position (cannot move further) record its absolute position by reading the value at the scale fixed on
        the launcher with the help of the indicator attached to the shovel.</p>
