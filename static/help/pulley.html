                <p>The diameter of the pulley that is attached to the step-motor is used to
                    calibrate the displacement of the shovel. A good initial guess can be obtained by measuring its
                    diameter
                    directly, as shown in the figure below. After storing this parameter in the micro-controller a more
                    accurate
                    calibration should be performed, described as the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        - move the shovel to the origin by sending the command "go to origin 2 2"
                    </li>
                    <li>- use the command "move forward" and request a displacement of 40 cm, e.g., "move forward 40 2
                        2" (speed of 2 cm/s is slow enough to guarantee a good calibration)
                    </li>
                    <li>- check how much was the actual displacement: reached position - origin position
                    </li>
                    <li>- if the displacement is different then the requested one (by more than 1 mm) scale linearly the
                        pulley
                        diameter to match the actual displacement with the requested one by using the formula:
                        <br>
                        New pulley diameter = Old pulley diameter x (Actual displacement / Requesteddisplacement)
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        - store the new "pulley diameter" in the micro-controller by using the command "set pulley
                        diameter"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        - resend the shovel back to the origin using the command "go to origin 2 2"
                    </li>
                    <li>- check the correctness made by using again the command "move forward" and request a
                        displacement
                        of 40 cm.
                        This
                        time the reached position should corresponds to a displacement of 40 cm.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
