    <p><strong>pulley diameter:</strong> The diameter of the pulley that is attached to the step-motor is used to
        calibrate the displacement of the shovel. A good initial guess can be obtained by measuring its diameter
        directly, as shown in the figure below. After storing this parameter in the micro-controller a more accurate
        calibration should be performed, described as the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            move the shovel to the origin by sending the command "go to origin 2 2"
        </li>
        <li>use the command "move forward" and request a displacement of 40 cm, e.g., "move forward 40 2 2" (speed of 2
            cm/s is slow enough to guarantee a good calibration)
        </li>
        <li>check how much was the actual displacement: reached position - origin position
        </li>
        <li>if the displacement is different then the requested one (by more than 1 mm) scale linearly the pulley
            diameter to match the actual displacement with the requested one by using the formula:
            <br>
            New pulley diameter = Old pulley diameter x (Actual displacement / Requesteddisplacement)
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            store the new "pulley diameter" in the micro-controller by using the command "set pulley diameter"
        </li>
        <li>
            resend the shovel back to the origin using the command "go to origin 2 2"
        </li>
        <li>check the correctness made by using again the command "move forward" and request a displacement of 40 cm.
            This
            time the reached position should corresponds to a displacement of 40 cm.
        </li>
    </ul>
