    <p><strong>vertical position:</strong> This position is obtained when the pendulum (ball + string) is in the
        perfectly vertical position. For that, slowly move the shovel in the backwards direction (towards the origin or
        micro-switch) until it has passed the vertical pendulum position. Wait for the ball to stop totally. Once the
        ball is fully stopped, approach the shovel in the direction of the ball until it touches the ball but without
        displacing it. Record the absolute shovel position by reading the value on the metric scale fixed on the
        launcher with the help of the indicator attached to the shovel.</p>
